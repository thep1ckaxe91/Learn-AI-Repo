# Week 1

Begin ML -> Cost function formula

Understandable

2 main type of ML:

- Supervised : training set is labelled
    

    + Regression : predict result on an infinite possible out come
    + Classification : group the result, works when there's small group of result, predict discrete labels or categories


- Unsupervised : training set is unlabelled
    
    + Cluster

Some conclusion:
- Gradient Descent is powerful to find local min
- Algo for each use case

# Week 2

- Understanding LiR with multiple features
- Vectorize with numpy help utilize hardware acc
- Feature scaling is necessary when the value is way to large or too small compare to other feature
- Feature Engineer help form the shape of the graph to be more fit in the training set
- Poly Reg is not much diff
