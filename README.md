Begin ML -> Cost function formula

Understandable

2 main type of ML:

- Supervised : training set is labelled
    

    + Regression : predict result on an infinite possible out come
    + Classification : group the result, works when there's small group of result, predict discrete labels or categories


- Unsupervised : training set is unlabelled, require to find pattern or...



# Week 2

- Some conclusion:
    + Gradient Descent:
        
        Can use in all most every function
        
            tmp_w = w_i - a * d(cost_w1-n,b)/d(w_i)
            tmp_b = b_i - a * d(cost_w1-n,b)/d(b_i)

        with:

            a : learning rate
            w_i, b : cost func param
